# Repository Summary

Last reviewed: 2026-07-03

This file is a quick map of the repository so future updates do not need to
rescan the whole folder before making small changes.

## Purpose

This repository hosts DBMS and MySQL learning materials as a GitHub Pages site.

Published site:

- https://vudmvn.github.io/dbms-course

## Site Architecture

- GitHub Pages is built with Jekyll.
- `_config.yml` controls the site metadata, URL, base path, Markdown behavior,
  included content folders, and excluded temporary/build files.
- `index.md` is the homepage and table of contents for the course.
- Content Markdown files are stored under topic folders, usually with local
  `images/` subfolders beside each lesson.
- GitHub Actions builds the site into `_site` and deploys it to Pages.

Important Jekyll settings:

- `url`: `https://vudmvn.github.io`
- `baseurl`: `/dbms-course`
- `markdown`: `kramdown`
- `permalink`: `pretty`
- Explicitly included folders: `introduction`, `MySQL`
- `entity-relationship-model/`, `relational-model-and-functional-dependencies/`, and `normalization/` are published as normal top-level content folders and are also
  covered by the Pages workflow trigger paths.
- Excluded temporary/build files include `TEMP_MARKDOWN_INPUT.md`, `node_modules`,
  and common LaTeX/log output files.

## Top-Level Structure

  - Each lesson generally lives in its own folder.
  - Some lessons include generated/source formats such as `.html`, `.tex`, and `.pdf`
    in addition to the publishable `.md` file.
  - `introduction/data-independence/` includes bilingual Beamer source `.tex`
    files and generated Vietnamese/English PDF slides.

## Canonical Lessons and Duplicate Reduction

Some older focused lessons remain in the repository for source preservation, but the homepage links to broader canonical lessons to reduce duplicated navigation content.

- `MySQL/database-administration/database/create-use-drop-database.md` is the canonical lesson for creating, selecting, and dropping databases.
  - Supersedes the separate `create-database`, `select-database`, and `drop-database` lessons in the homepage navigation.
- `MySQL/data-definition/create-table-statement.md` and `MySQL/data-definition/table/tables.md` are the canonical lessons for `CREATE TABLE`, constraints, and table lifecycle topics.
  - Supersedes the separate basic `sql-create-table` homepage entry.
- `MySQL/data-modification-transactions/modifying-data.md` is the canonical lesson for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and advanced modification topics.
  - Supersedes the separate `insert-update-delete` homepage entry.
## Deployment Flow

Current working branch and push target:

- Local branch: `deploy-dbms-pages`
- Tracking branch: `course/main`
- GitHub Pages repo remote: `course` -> `https://github.com/vudmvn/dbms-course.git`
- Source/development remote: `origin` -> `https://github.com/vudmvn/dbms.git`
- Because the local branch name differs from `main`, push with:

```powershell
git push course HEAD:main
```

Recommended commit/push process:

1. Check scope first:

```powershell
git status -sb
git diff -- <paths>
```

2. Stage only intended files. Do not stage `TEMP_MARKDOWN_INPUT.md` unless
   explicitly requested. For ER model lessons, keep `.webp` files for Markdown
   pages and matching `.png` files for LaTeX/PDF builds when both are referenced.

```powershell
git add -- <intended-files>
```

3. Commit with a short message:

```powershell
git commit -m "Short change summary"
```

4. Push to the Pages repository:

```powershell
git push course HEAD:main
```

5. Confirm the workflow:

```powershell
gh run list --repo vudmvn/dbms-course --limit 5
```

6. Check the public page and any images directly with `Invoke-WebRequest`.

General content flow:

1. Add or edit Markdown content under `introduction/`, `entity-relationship-model/`, `relational-model-and-functional-dependencies/`, `normalization/`, or `MySQL/`.
2. Add any lesson images inside that lesson folder, usually under `images/`.
3. Update `index.md` if the lesson should appear on the homepage.
4. Commit and push to `course/main`.
5. GitHub Actions workflow `Deploy GitHub Pages` builds with Jekyll and deploys.

Workflow trigger paths:

- `introduction/**`
- `entity-relationship-model/**`, `relational-model-and-functional-dependencies/**`, `normalization/**`
- `MySQL/**`
- `index.md`
- `_config.yml`
- `DEPLOYMENT_RULES.md`
- `.github/workflows/pages.yml`

## Update Notes

- 2026-06-04: Refreshed `entity-relationship-model/er-model/` attribute and relationship
  image references against the GeeksforGeeks source, then regenerated the
  Vietnamese and English ER model PDFs.
- 2026-06-04: Expanded `MySQL/mysql-server/storage-engine/` into a full lecture, kept its
  `images/` placeholder, and linked it from the bilingual homepage.
- 2026-06-04: Added `entity-relationship-model/lab-er-model-1.md` and a bilingual Labs
  section in `index.md`.
- 2026-06-04: Refreshed the repository summary against current `index.md`,
  `_config.yml`, workflow paths, branch, and remotes.
- 2026-06-01: Added bilingual PDF slides and Beamer source files for
  `introduction/data-independence/`, and linked the slides from `index.md`.
- 2026-06-01: Expanded `entity-relationship-model/er-model/` with ER diagram illustrations
  for entities, attributes, relationships, cardinality, participation, and ER
  diagram construction steps.
- 2026-06-01: Added Vietnamese and English ER model Beamer slides/PDFs, linked
  them from `index.md`, and refreshed ER cardinality/participation images to
  match the GeeksforGeeks source page.
- 2026-06-01: Added `MySQL/mysql-server/mysql-sample-database/` with the classicmodels
  sample database lesson and local ER diagram image.
- 2026-05-31: Added `entity-relationship-model/`, `relational-model-and-functional-dependencies/`, and `normalization/` lessons and renamed the folder from
  `Data Modeling` to avoid space-encoded URLs.
- 2026-05-31: Added `entity-relationship-model/**`, `relational-model-and-functional-dependencies/**`, `normalization/**` to the Pages workflow trigger paths so
  edits in that folder rebuild GitHub Pages.
- 2026-05-31: Documented the practical commit/push flow for the
  `deploy-dbms-pages` branch and `course/main` remote.
- 2026-05-28: Added this repository summary file.
- 2026-05-28: Updated `index.md` with a Vietnamese/English language switcher.
- 2026-05-27: Deployment rules note says the latest deploy activation was on this date.
- Current git status during review was clean before editing this file.

## Maintenance Notes

- Keep lesson links in `index.md` relative to the repository root.
- Because `_config.yml` uses `baseurl: /dbms-course`, avoid hard-coding root-relative
  links like `/assets/...` unless they are passed through Jekyll URL filters.
- For lesson pages using `permalink`, prefer a permalink that matches the lesson
  folder, for example `permalink: /entity-relationship-model/er-model/`. This lets local
  image links such as `images/example.png` work both locally and on GitHub Pages.
- If a page is served at a nested pretty URL such as
  `/folder/lesson/lesson/`, relative image links like `images/x.png` will point
  to the wrong folder on the website. Either add an appropriate `permalink` or
  adjust image paths deliberately.
- Markdown files do not need YAML front matter because `jekyll-optional-front-matter`
  is enabled.
- If adding a new top-level publishable content folder, update
  `.github/workflows/pages.yml` trigger paths. Add it to `_config.yml` under
  `include` only when Jekyll needs explicit inclusion for that path.
- Avoid relying on `TEMP_MARKDOWN_INPUT.md` for published content; it is excluded.
- PowerShell currently prints a local profile warning about missing
  `D:\Anaconda\Scripts\conda.exe`; command results are still usable despite that
  warning.
